# Upstreaming to [`apple/swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift/)

One of the goals of SwiftWasm is to upstream our changes to [`apple/swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift/) as much as possible.
This document describes our upstreaming process and how we should keep our friendly fork.

## Our current status

We are maintaining several patches in [`swiftwasm/swiftwasm-build`](https://github.com/swiftwasm/swiftwasm-build/tree/main/schemes/main/swift).
We had been maintaining a fork of [`apple/swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift) before, but we stopped it because we already have upstreamed most of our changes, and it is hard to maintain the fork for several reasons (See [faq.md](./faq.md) for details).

Most of our patches are ready to be upstreamed, but some of them marked as `HACK` are not ready yet.

## Upstreaming Process

1. Check if the patch is already upstreamed or not. Some patches are already upstreamed but nightly snapshot tag can be not updated yet.
2. If the patch is not upstreamed yet and ready to be upstreamed, create a PR to [`apple/swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift).
3. Test the PR in [`ci.swift.org`](https://ci.swift.org/) and [`ci-external.swift.org`](https://ci-external.swift.org/). Use the following CI command:

   ```
   @swift-ci Please smoke test
   ```
   ```
   preset=buildbot_incremental_linux_crosscompile_wasm
   @swift-ci Please test with preset Linux Platform
   ```
4. If the CI is green and got approval from the upstream reviewers, merge the PR.
5. Ensure that the patch does not break the CI. If it breaks the CI, revert the commit or fix it ASAP.

## What we should keep in green âœ…

1. ci.swift.org: Jenkins CI hosted by Apple and used to test every PR and the latest `main` branch commit of [`apple/swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift).
2. [WebAssembly cross-compiler test in ci-external.swift.org](https://ci-external.swift.org/job/oss-swift-RA-linux-ubuntu-20.04-webassembly/): Jenkins CI hosted by SwiftWasm but joins the Apple's Swift CI system. Run tests for the latest `main` branch commit of [`apple/swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift). The CI status is notified in SwiftWasm Discord server.

If our upstreaming commits break ci.swift.org, we should revert the commit or fix it ASAP.

## Milestones

1. Upstream compiler patches
  If we upstream all of our compiler patches, we can stop building our own compiler and use the official Swift compiler instead.
  After that, we can focus on building standard library and save much time.

2. Upstream standard library patches
3. Set up WebAssembly check in ci.swift.org and make it mandatory to pass the check to merge a PR like [the Windows check](https://ci-external.swift.org/job/swift-PR-windows/)
