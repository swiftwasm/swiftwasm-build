# Maintainance workflow

To keep our project healthy, maintainers are expected to work on the following tasks:

1. [Downstreaming](./docs/downstreaming.md): Keep the project up to date with the latest upstream changes
2. [Upstreaming](./docs/upstreaming.md): Avoid divergence from the upstream project
3. [Release](./docs/release.md): Publish new versions of the project

See each specific document for more details.
