# Maintainance workflow

To keep our project healthy, maintainers are expected to work on the following tasks:

1. [Downstreaming](./downstreaming.md): Keep the project up to date with the latest upstream changes
2. [Upstreaming](./upstreaming.md): Avoid divergence from the upstream project
3. [Release](./release.md): Publish new versions of the toolchain

See each specific document for more details.
